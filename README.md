# Power analysis for random effects in mixed models


###Description:
Simulation functions to assess or explore the power of
a dataset to estimates significant random effects in a mixed model.
The functions are based on the "lme4" package.

variation in reaction norms in field and experimental studies: a power

###Note
Code as been fixed to work with the latest version of lme4 and lmerTest packages
implementation of better simulation function based on simulate merMod is in development
